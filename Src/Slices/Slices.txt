In your project, slices are defined using Redux Toolkit's createSlice function. Slices are a way to manage different parts of the application's state. Each slice typically corresponds to a specific feature or domain in your application. Here are the slices in your project and their purposes:

Auth Slice (authSlice.js):

Purpose: Manages authentication-related state, such as signup data, loading status, and authentication token.
Reducers:
setSignupData: Updates the signup data.
setLoading: Updates the loading status.
setToken: Updates the authentication token.

Category Slice (categorySlice.js):

Purpose: Manages state related to categories, such as category list and loading status.
Reducers:
setCategories: Updates the list of categories.
setLoading: Updates the loading status.
Course Slice (courseSlice.js):

Purpose: Manages state related to courses, such as course list, course details, and loading status.
Reducers:
setCourses: Updates the list of courses.
setCourseDetails: Updates the details of a specific course.
setLoading: Updates the loading status.

User Slice (userSlice.js):

Purpose: Manages state related to user information, such as user profile and loading status.
Reducers:
setUserProfile: Updates the user profile.
setLoading: Updates the loading status.

Store Configuration (store.js):

All slices are combined in the Redux store configuration. The store is created using configureStore from Redux Toolkit, where each slice reducer is added to the store.
Components:

Components in your application use the state and actions from the slices. For example, a login component might dispatch actions from the authSlice to update the authentication state.
Actions and Selectors:

Actions generated by the slices are used to dispatch changes to the state. Selectors are used to read specific parts of the state from the store.

**************************************************************************************

Reducers are pure functions in Redux that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. They take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state. Reducers must be pure, meaning they should not mutate the state directly but instead return a new state object.

Characteristics of Reducers
Pure Functions: They do not have side effects and always produce the same output given the same input.
Immutable Updates: They do not mutate the existing state but return a new state object.
Action Handling: They determine how the state should change based on the action type and payload.
Reducers are a core concept in Redux, enabling predictable state transitions and making state management more manageable and scalable.
